ISO-country-flags-icons
=======================

ISO country flags icons SVGs with PNG fall-back

## Getting Started
This project requires Grunt to compile a custom version

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-grunticon --save-dev
```

## Usage
 use the classes: flagicon flag-{countrycode)
```html
<span class="flagicon flag-gb"></span>
```

Project uses modernizr to dectect SVG support.

##Coming soon

* Example Files
* Better instructions
* Refactor Grunt file
